This is a very simple project using only html(no css styling) to build a basic coffe shop website.
Features:-
  1)back to top button in bottom of each page.
  2)Html forms and tables are implemented.
 note: The website looks crappy and irresponsive in mobile devices due to lack of css styling and as I'm new to web designing,so forgive me :)
